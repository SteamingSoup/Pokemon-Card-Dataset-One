# Pokemon-Card-Dataset-One
Trying out web scraping by creating a dataset of pokemon card prices. This is purely for practice after having learned about some similar methods during graduate school.
Will be done using python to parse through sites HTML. I plan on performing this kind of web scraping on two different sites for comparison.
